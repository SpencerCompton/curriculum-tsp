Development:
1) Restructure files
    - flesh out constants better
    - understand models -- what is actor critic?
    - streamline model loading and partial training
    - cut out picture generation
    - make better naming schemes
2) Restructure directories
    - job_scripts could be renamed jobs
3) Test to make sure restructure works
    - interactive environment and debug.sh with small train/test set sizes
    - non-interactive environment with sbatch on a real job script with reduced dataset

Openmind:
1) Rerun training job
2) Evaluate on more: 50-100 validation set
3) Run adversarial training job

Research:
1) Decide on a parameterization of distribution
2) Implement adversarial training approach
