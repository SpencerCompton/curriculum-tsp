1) Figure out resource consumption of tsp-100 tasks
    - who knows how much ram it takes
    - takes around 10GB gpu memory (yikes)
    - assumption 16 gb ram is enough
2) Figure out how quickly/slowly --regen runs
    - around 400 seconds (7 minutes) per regen for tsp-20
    - around 2000 seconds (35 minutes) for tsp-100

3) Run test jobs for static and experiments 1-17

4) run static-20, static-100, dynamic-20, dynamic-100
5) run experiments 1-17 with --num-nodes 100
